<h3>A More Complete Biography</h3>
<p>Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.</li>
<li>I direct <a href="http://chrp.org/biostatistics-evaluation/">Biostatistics and Evaluation</a> at the <a href="http://chrp.org/">Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy</a>, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center.</li>
<li>For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for <a href="http://betterhealthpartnership.org/">Better Health Partnership</a>, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.</li>
<li>I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research.</li>
<li>I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be interested in a <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1121.abstract">recent study in Health Affairs</a> showing the impact of a <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-shows-prepared-safety-net-improves-care-saves-money-in-medicaid-expansion-population/">Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland</a>.</li>
<li>Or you might be interested in our <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1102519">New England Journal of Medicine study</a> of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes.</li>
<li>In 2011, <a href="http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/faculty/a-james-omalley-phd">James O’Malley</a> and I chaired the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2011/index.cfm?fuseaction=main">Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics</a>, here in Cleveland. Here’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10742-012-0096-8">recap</a>. We may chair it again in 2021.</li>
<li>I’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/browse/collection/48415155/?sort=date&amp;direction=ascending">pretty complete list of my publications</a>, knock yourself out.</p>
<p>I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation advisor was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman and we are raising two terrific sons, one of whom just started college. I live in Shaker Heights.</p>

<div id="teaching-assistants" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Teaching Assistants</h2>
<p>The teaching assistants for 431 this year are Claudia Cabrera, Omar Alaber, Kara Quaid, Rosie Conic and Bob Winkelman. They are the people answering 431-help at case dot edu, and they are the people holding the bulk of our office hours. Each of them has been in your shoes - they’ve taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. Many have volunteered their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn’t be more delighted to welcome you to the course.</p>
<p>To contact the TAs, email <code>431-help at case dot edu</code>.</p>
