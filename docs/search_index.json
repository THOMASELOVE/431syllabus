["course-description.html", "Chapter 1 Course Description 1.1 What do we want people to learn in the 431-432 sequence? 1.2 What do we assume you know before you take the course? 1.3 Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432?", " Chapter 1 Course Description PQHS 431 (cross-listed as, CRSP 431 and MPHP 431) is the first half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 432) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent and as little theory as possible. We emphasize the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The course is formally titled *Statistical Methods in Biological &amp; Medical Sciences, Part 1.&quot; A more accurate title is Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. We’ll learn about managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other “data science” activities. This highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. We’ll learn a lot of R, and we’ll use R Studio and Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways. 1.1 What do we want people to learn in the 431-432 sequence? Using modern data science tools to import, tidy/manage, explore (through transforming, visualizing, and modeling) and communicate about data. Thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in scientific research. We students to see the value of statistical thinking throughout the process of doing scientific research. Programming in R sufficient to accomplish the tasks above, with enough self-sufficiency afterwards to be able to debug and use new R tools without substantial troubleshooting help from others. The importance of replicable research, and facility and practice in open source tools (R Markdown, and [new] GitHub, too, for EPBI students) to do it, all the time, as a matter of course. Sufficient background in the practical issues regarding linear and generalized linear models (a big example: missing data) to permit them to have a starting place for meaningful applied work / consulting, particularly in terms of making comparisons to address several types of questions (exploratory, predictive, inferential, and causal, in particular.) 1.2 What do we assume you know before you take the course? Not much. Useful prior experience includes training/experience in statistics, coding/programming and biology/biomedical science. We expect most people will have some experience in one or two of these areas, but very few have all three. Some students have lots of prior training in statistics. But there are many students in the class with no statistical training at all that they use regularly. We assume only that everyone knows what an average is, and has some sense of why statistics might be useful to them in their chosen field. Some students have lots of prior coding and programming experience, including experience with R. Some have never written a line of code in their life. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn how to do modern statistical work, and that means writing computer code, but that some people will be starting from nothing. Some students have lots of prior experience with biological and biomedical science, and know a lot of useful things in those areas which relate directly to our work. Others have zero experience in this area, and will learn a lot from their colleagues in this regard. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn, and put in some effort to do so. People take this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology, health or medicine. There will be multiple people in the class who are years away from their last statistics class, and the vast majority of students will have no prior experience using R, or any meaningful recollection of using statistical software. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. 1.3 Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432? Because it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period. "],
["texts.html", "Chapter 2 Texts 2.1 Books To Purchase 2.2 Free Resources You’ll Need To Get 2.3 Other, Optional Resources", " Chapter 2 Texts The main text is a set of Notes for the course, maintained by Dr. Love at https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes/. Although the Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students in Section 1 (and Section 2) a set of common materials on which to draw during the course, providing a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up during the semester. The material will be updated regularly as the semester progresses. 2.1 Books To Purchase In addition, we’ll read two books that you’ll need to purchase (the combined price is about $25.): Nate Silver’s The Signal and The Noise ISBN-13: 978-1594204111, and Jeff Leek’s The Elements of Data Analytic Style, available at https://leanpub.com/datastyle. 2.2 Free Resources You’ll Need To Get OpenIntro Statistics (OpenStats) by David Diez, Christopher Barr and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, download at https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os R for Data Science (R4DS) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, which may be read at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/ Practical Regression and ANOVA using R, by Julian J. Faraway, (Faraway) which is one of the “More Free Books” to download at https://www.openintro.org/stat/extras.php. The more formal presentation is in Linear Models with R, Second Edition by Julian J. Faraway (Chapman and Hall / CRC Texts in Statistical Science) ISBN-13: 978-1439887332. But the free text is sufficient for 431 and, probably 432. 2.3 Other, Optional Resources "],
["class-schedule.html", "Chapter 3 Class Schedule 3.1 Topics Discussed Extensively in 431 and its follow-up, 432", " Chapter 3 Class Schedule The first five classes are more about R and R Studio than about statistics. Once everyone’s gotten rolling, our approach changes a bit to focus more on statistical concerns, and less on the technology. You’ll note that the Topics listed here are mainly suggestions. The course divides neatly into three parts. Part A begins in Class 2 and is about Visualizing Data. Part B begins in Class 10 or so, and is about Making Comparisons. Part C begins with class 19 or so. It’s about Building Regression Models. For more details on what will be covered within each Part of the course, Dr. Love’s Notes for the course.

Placing biological, medical and health research questions into a statistical framework. Study Development - making choices in designing and executing the collection and aggregation of data. Data Handling - including important issues in importing, tidying and transforming data, as well as methods for dealing with missing data, including imputation. Statistical Comparisons: “All of statistics are comparisons” - including methods for discrete and continuous variables: intervals, assumptions, some thoughts on statistical power, and the bootstrap, design of visualizations and models for rates, proportions and contingency tables. The proper use of multi-predictor models for continuous and discrete data, including… Fitting, evaluating, and interpreting linear and generalized linear models. Prediction and validation. Critical role of graphics, including diagnostics and residual analysis. Model choice, including variable selection, shrinkage and model uncertainty. Dealing with categorical predictors and interactions meaningfully. Causal inference using regression: controlling for covariates meaningfully. Using R and R Studio to make all of the things above happen; with particular emphasis on doing replicable research and using Markdown to document the work. "],
